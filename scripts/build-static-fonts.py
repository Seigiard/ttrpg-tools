"""Regenerate the theme's static font instances from its variable sources.

Run with `npm run fonts:build` (which is `uv run scripts/build-static-fonts.py`);
uv installs the two pinned dependencies above into a throwaway environment, so
nothing has to be added to package.json or to a developer's machine.

Why static instances exist at all (issue #9). Chromium's PDF backend falls back
to Type 3 -- a per-glyph drawing procedure rather than an embedded outline font
program -- for any typeface whose file declares variation axes. It tests for the
presence of `fvar`, not for a non-default coordinate, so no CSS declaration can
talk it out of it: `SkPDFFont::FontType()` forces the fallback on
`kVariable_FontFlag`, and every platform backend sets that flag from axis
presence alone. The only fix is to hand the browser files that have no axes.

Each output is therefore pinned to one weight, which drops `fvar`/`gvar`/`avar`,
and then subsetted to the four scripts this theme supports, which removes about
fifteen hundred glyphs a rulebook never uses. The pin buys the font type; the
subset buys the size. Both outputs are committed next to their sources, because
the theme imports them through Vite's `?inline` and a build that had to run
Python would break `npm run build` for everyone.

Layout, per family, under src/features/grimoire/core/themes/default-ru/fonts: the upstream
variable file in `upstream`, this script's output beside it, and the licence
next to both.

The generated files are derived work under the same SIL Open Font License as the
sources; each family's OFL.txt sits beside them. Neither family reserves its
name, so the instances keep the upstream family names.
