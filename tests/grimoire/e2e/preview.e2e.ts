/**
 * Issue #6's first handed-over defect: a slow repaint finishing after a faster,
 * newer one used to clobber the container back to stale content. The consumer is
 * an author who keeps writing (or clicks refresh again) while a repaint is still
 * running; the observable failure is the container ending up showing the older
 * request instead of the newest one made. Real Vivliostyle timing turned out not
 * to be a reliable oracle for this -- a real "slow" document large enough to
 * outlast the gap between two rapid actions on a fast machine could still finish
 * before the second request landed, or vice versa, on every machine this suite
 * runs on. Substituting the pagination adapter with a version whose delay is
 * fixed instead of measured -- at the exact seam issue #1's architecture built for
 * this -- makes the race deterministic while every other real behaviour
 * (`startApp`'s own run/pending queue, `renderBook`, real DOM writes) is untouched.
