 * renderer against itself. Where a claim is comparative -- "the chapters around a
 * page are laid out as they are without it" -- the other side of the comparison is
 * the same engine paginating a book this file wrote, not a number this file
 * predicted. Where a claim is absolute -- "forty millimetres down lands forty
