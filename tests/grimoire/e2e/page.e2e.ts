 * Consumer: an author who writes a page between two chapters -- a character sheet,

 * its own page indices, and the geometry it laid out, read back from the pages it
 * produced. Never render-book.ts's CSS or markup, which would only test the
 * renderer against itself. Where a claim is comparative -- "the chapters around a
 * page are laid out as they are without it" -- the other side of the comparison is
 * the same engine paginating a book this file wrote, not a number this file
 * predicted. Where a claim is absolute -- "forty millimetres down lands forty
 * millimetres down" -- the expected value is the offset the book's own source
 * declares, converted by CSS's own definition of a millimetre and measured from a
 * page origin the engine reported.
