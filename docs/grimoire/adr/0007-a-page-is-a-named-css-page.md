# A page is a named CSS page, not a canvas element we size ourselves

A `Page` is one physical page whose arrangement the author composes: a character sheet, a
reference card, a table that must sit alone. Two routes were measured against the real
engine.

The obvious one is a block element sized to the page area with `position: relative`, given
`break-before: page` and `break-after: page`. The other is CSS Paged Media's own named
pages: `page: <name>` on the element, and a `@page <name>` rule for whatever that named
page declares of its own.

We take the named page. This ADR records the measurements, because both routes work well
enough in a first test that the difference only shows under pressure.

## What the engine actually gave us

Driving `paginate()` with a book of flow text, a named page, and more flow text, no break
declared anywhere:

```text
pageCount: 3      pageSizes: 559x794, 794x559, 559x794
margin boxes: [0] top=FLOW bottom=1   [1] none   [2] top=AFTER bottom=3
an absolute box declared top: 40mm; left: 20mm landed at exactly 20mm, 40mm
```

The named page broke the flow on both sides by itself, turned landscape on its own, took
its own zero margins, suppressed its own running header with
`@top-center { content: none }` while the neighbouring pages kept theirs, and let the page
counter run through it. The adapter reported the mixed page sizes correctly.

None of that had to be built. The hand-rolled canvas gets none of it: it needs the page
size restated in CSS, its own break declarations, and it cannot carry a size, a margin or
a margin box of its own at all.

Every line above was measured with a `@page <name>` rule declared, because each of those
behaviours is something that rule asks for. The break on both sides is the exception: it
comes from the used page name changing, so `page: <name>` on the element produces it
alone, and an empty rule beside it changes nothing. The renderer therefore emits the rule
only once a page has something of its own to declare, such as an orientation or a
suppressed running header, and emits the name always.

## The trap that decided it

A canvas sized to the page area fragments when a child's top margin collapses through its
top edge. Measured: a canvas holding an `<h2>` with its default margin is pushed 5.24mm
down, no longer fits, splits across two pages, and the author's absolutely positioned
content lands on the **next** page, 4.24mm out of place. `break-inside: avoid` does not
prevent it. `margin: 0` on the child, `display: flow-root` and `overflow: hidden` each do.

So the hand-rolled route asks an author to know about margin collapsing to keep their
character sheet on one page. A named page's own geometry is never the thing that
overflows, so it cannot fail this way.

## What the named page does not give us

It is a page *style*, not a page *quota*. A named page holding fourteen paragraphs
produced two pages, both carrying the named page's own margin box. So "exactly one page"
remains ours to check. The pagination adapter counts the physical page indices occupied
by each declared page and reports a page that spans more than one sheet.

## The frame of reference comes free, and this record was wrong about how

We wrote here that the renderer would emit a `position: relative` wrapper to make
`top`/`left` inside a page mean what the author expects. Measured while building the page,
that wrapper is not needed and is actively harmful. The engine already makes the page
area the containing block for absolutely positioned content on a named page. Interposing
a wrapper of our own takes that away, because the wrapper is as tall as its content rather
than as tall as the page: a box declared `bottom: 20mm` then lands 20mm below the top of
the sheet instead of 20mm above its foot, `top: 50%` resolves against a box of no height,
and a page opening with a heading drifts 5.67mm down as that heading's margin collapses
through the wrapper. This is the same margin-collapse trap described above, reintroduced
by the fix for it. Sizing the wrapper to the page would correct all three and is exactly
the hand-rolled canvas measured and rejected above.

So the renderer emits the page name and nothing else. The frame of reference is the page
area itself, which is what makes a `Page` worth more than a `div`: a `div` an author
writes gets no sheet of its own to resolve against.

## Page size stays with the Book

A Theme may style page margin boxes and other visual properties through an unnamed or
pseudo-page `@page` rule, but it may not bind the Book at another size. The renderer puts
the visual fallbacks and Theme in one cascade layer, in that source order, while an
earlier ownership layer holds important Book and oriented-Page size declarations.
Important declarations reverse layer order, so Book geometry wins even when Theme CSS
uses `!important` or a more-specific selector such as `@page :first`. Within the ownership
layer, named-page specificity gives an oriented Page the Book's turned sheet.

The layer is an ownership boundary, not only a convention for the current Theme. Theme
CSS stays verbatim and keeps its ordinary cascade over fallback visual properties, but
cannot create two sheet formats in one bound Book.

## Content pushed off the sheet is not reported

Measured: content positioned past the page box is laid out, gets real coordinates, and is
then clipped by the engine's bleed box. It is absent from the printed PDF and it does not
change the page count. Content that lands in the *margin* prints normally.

We are not detecting this. Overflow is caught by counting pages, which is cheap; clipping
would need the geometry of every element on every page, which is not, and an author who
placed a box past the edge of the sheet chose those coordinates deliberately. This is a
decision and not an oversight: the editor tells an author when a page became two, and says
nothing when a box was put off the paper.
