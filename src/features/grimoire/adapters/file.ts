 * The exchange format for a book (CONTEXT.md's "saved file"): a browser reading and
 * writing a local file, no server involved. A book's source already names its own
 * theme -- `<Book theme="default-ru">` is part of the text itself (see
 * `core/parse-book.ts`) -- so carrying the source is carrying the theme; nothing
 * about the theme is serialized a second time.
 *
 * The envelope beyond the bare source exists for one reason: `parseBook` accepts
 * almost any string as a valid book (bare prose with no `<Book>` wrapper is a
 * complete book, sized by `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`), so a `.txt` file would never be
 * reported as "not a book" -- it would just render as an odd one. The `format`
 * marker below is what lets `loadBookFile` tell a Grimoire Press save apart from
 * an unrelated file (a PDF, an image, someone else's JSON) and reject the latter
 * the way issue #1's error surface requires: "a file that cannot be read as a book."
