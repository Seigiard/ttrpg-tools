 * out, carrying the resulting page count — Vivliostyle's own pagination, never ours.
 *
 * Loads the document from a blob URL rather than a served path: the document is a
 * string the app just built in memory, not a resource that lives at a URL.
 *
 * All-or-nothing about `container`'s contents (issue #11): when it settles, the
 * container either holds a newly paginated book or exactly the children it held on
 * the way in -- never the empty space that a failed run used to leave behind. A
 * timeout is a way of settling, so it restores the container as an engine failure
 * does; anything less would reintroduce the blank preview issue #11 closed, by a
 * different door.
 *
 * Rejects if the engine makes no progress for `PAGINATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, so the
 * caller's own guards are released and the next edit starts a fresh attempt (issue
 * #10). The engine's work cannot be called off, so that run stays alive and may still
 * answer afterwards. Every listener this call registered is removed at the moment it
 * gives up, which is what keeps the late answer from putting a stale book back over
 * whatever the preview has moved on to.
 *
 * The guarantee is about children, and only against this adapter's own handlers.
 * `removeListener` detaches from the viewer's event target; the object that writes to
 * `container` is the viewer's internal one, and nothing detaches that. Measured, on
 * an abandoned run resumed to completion: its *pages* never reach the preview, because
 * the restore takes the engine's own viewport subtree out of the document with the
 * rest of the children, and a detached element has no geometry for the engine to lay
 * out against (ADR-0005) -- so the run halts where it stands, writing into a subtree
 * nobody can see. Its *attributes* do reach it: `data-vivliostyle-viewer-status` and
 * `data-vivliostyle-page-progression` are written straight onto `container`, and land
 * there again a moment after the restore has put the old values back. Nothing styles
 * off them, so today this is residue rather than a visible defect, and it is as far
 * as a bound can go without a staging container. Issue #15 carries that.

 * The pages that took more than the one physical page they claim, read off the

 * -- measured, fourteen paragraphs inside one produced two pages, both carrying its
 * own styling -- so the engine will not prevent this and "exactly one page" stays
 * ours to check.
 *
 * The check is a count. `render-book.ts` marks a page's own element with
 * `data-grimoire-page`, beside the source line it was declared on; the engine
 * renders a block once per physical page it occupies, inside that page's own
 * container. So a page that fits appears under one page index and a page that
 * spilled appears under several, and the number of distinct indices is the number
 * of pages it took.
 *
 * The mark, and not the `page` class or `data-line` alone: a book may contain raw
 * HTML (ADR-0006), so an author writing either of those by hand would otherwise
 * make their own book report an overflow that never happened.
 *
 * Nothing here rejects, and the caller is handed this beside the page count rather
 * than instead of it: the book paginated, and an author deciding what to cut needs
 * to see what spilled.
