/**
 * Recognises the book's markup tags -- `<Book>`, `<Section>`, `<Page>`,
 * `<PageBreak />`, `<ColumnBreak />` -- against a single source line. This is the one
 * place that decides what counts as one of the book's tags: `parse-book.ts` calls it
 * to build a book's structure, and the editor's CodeMirror extension
 * (`adapters/markup-syntax.ts`) calls it to highlight the same lines. Sharing this
 * function is what the parent issue means by "one grammar" -- highlighting cannot
 * disagree with what a tag does, because both read the same recognition rules.
 *
 * A tag occupies an entire line by itself; one that shares a line with prose is not
 * recognised as a tag; the tag-in-prose case is out of scope for this version.

// failing to match any tag and being reported as prose outside every block. Still
