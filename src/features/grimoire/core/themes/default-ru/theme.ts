/**
 * Vollkorn (body) and Alegreya (headings), both covering Cyrillic and Latin in
 * the same face -- see `magick.css`'s header for why these replace magick.css's
 * original two typefaces, and CONTEXT.md's Theme entry for why one face per
 * role, not one face per alphabet, is the point.
 *
 * `?inline` (Vite's own asset-import suffix, not a project convention) turns
 * each WOFF2 file into a base64 `data:` URI at import time. That is the
 * self-hosting: the finished document embeds the font bytes directly in its
 * `<style>`, so nothing -- preview, print, or a test loading this HTML
 * standalone -- ever issues a request for a typeface, to this host or any
 * other. `?raw` does the equivalent for magick.css: its text, unmodified by
 * any bundler transform, ends up verbatim in the theme's CSS.
 *
 * Seven files, one per weight and style the theme's CSS can reach, rather
 * than the two variable files per family these used to be (issue #9). Both
 * families ship upstream as variable fonts with a 400-900 weight axis, and
 * Chromium's PDF backend refuses to embed any typeface whose file declares
 * variation axes: it writes every glyph as a Type 3 drawing procedure instead
 * of embedding the outline font program, so the printed book carried no real
 * typeface at all. The test is for the presence of the `fvar` table, not for
 * a non-default coordinate, so no `@font-face` declaration can avoid it --
 * narrowing `font-weight` to a single value was measured and made the PDF 84%
 * larger, because the missing weight was then faked by synthetic emboldening.
 * The only fix is files with no axes, which is what
 * `scripts/build-static-fonts.py` produces from the variable sources kept
 * beside them under each family's `upstream` directory.
 *
 * Seven and not eight because Alegreya italic at 400 is unreachable: Alegreya is
 * set in `h1`..`h4` at weight 600 and in `@top-center` at weight 400 with
 * `font-style: normal`, and a margin box's content comes from
 * `string(current-heading)`, which carries no markup to make italic out of. A
 * rule that does reach it brings its own file.
 *
 * Every weight and style the theme's own CSS can ask for needs a real file
 * here. A weight with no file is either synthesised by the browser or matched
 * against a file that does not carry it, and either way the face on the page
 * is not the face this theme chose. That is also why none of these declares a
 * weight *range*: a leftover `400 900` is an exact match for 600 and would win
 * over the real 600 file, quietly putting the variable file -- and Type 3 --
 * back on the page.
