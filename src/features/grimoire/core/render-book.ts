 * own element, with the name taken from the page's position at the top level of the
 * book so that no two blocks ever share one. A break is forced wherever the used
 * page name changes, so the engine ends the preceding block, gives the page a sheet
 * to itself and starts the following block on a fresh sheet, with nothing declared
 * by the author. Sharing a name between two pages would quietly undo that and make
 * two pages one.
 *
 * A `@page <name>` rule is emitted beside it for whatever that page declares of its
 * own (ADR-0007). Every page declares at least one thing -- no running header -- so
 * every page now gets a rule; the breaks are not what it is for, since those come
 * from the used page name changing whether a rule is there or not.

 *
 * Page size, columns, forced breaks and a page's own sheet are expressed as CSS
 * Paged Media -- `@page size`, `column-count`, `break-before`, and a named page
 * (issue #20, ADR-0007) -- laid out by Vivliostyle; nothing here computes layout
 * itself. Running headers and page numbers (issue #5) are the same kind of thing:
 * `@page` margin boxes fed by `string-set`/`content()` on a heading and by
 * `counter(page)`, resolved by Vivliostyle, never computed here.
 *
 * A book's theme (issue #4), when it names one, is embedded the same way: its CSS
 * -- including its own self-hosted `@font-face` rules -- lands verbatim in this
 * `<style>` block after the plain fallback in the same visual cascade layer, so
 * its visual rules win. Page size is the exception: a higher-priority ownership
 * layer holds the Book's declaration because binding the Book is not part of a
 * Theme's visual identity (issue #28).
 * A themeless book keeps exactly the styling it had before themes existed.
