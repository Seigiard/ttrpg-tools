 * three seams, three arguments (ADR-0004).
 *
 * Persistence is delegated to a `read`/`write` adapter pair that reads and writes
 * the draft to browser storage. `write` is responsible for debouncing.
 *
 * The preview markup is derived whenever it is needed, to repaint and to print
 * alike, rather than stored -- ADR-0004's derived-state model, amended to record
 * the scheduling state this ticket adds (see the ADR itself for why the
 * conclusion still holds).
 *
 * The preview's own refresh is a second, independent debounce (issue #6): typing
 * always updates the persisted draft on its own schedule, but only schedules a
 * repaint when automatic refreshing is on. A repaint request while one is already
 * running never starts a second one -- it replaces whatever request was already
 * waiting and is picked up the moment the running one settles, so two repaints are
 * never in flight together and the last request made is always the last one that
 * reaches the container (issue #6's first handed-over defect: overlapping repaints
 * had no cancellation, so a slow one could finish after, and clobber, a faster
 * newer one).
 *
 * Downloading and loading a book (issue #8) are wired the same way: two more
 * adapter functions, each its own parameter. Loading replaces the editor's whole
 * buffer -- through `EditorHandle.setSource`, so it flows through the same
 * `onChange` a keystroke would and is persisted as the new draft the same way --
 * after the author confirms, since there is no way back from replacing a book
 * other than CodeMirror's own undo history. The confirmation is asked only once
 * the file has already been read and validated, so declining it is the only way a
 * load has any visible effect on a book that turns out fine; a file this editor
 * cannot read as a book never reaches the question at all.
