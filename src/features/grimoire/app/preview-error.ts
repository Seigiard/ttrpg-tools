 * The preview's whole error surface (issues #6, #8 and #10): five closed cases the
 * application must decide what to tell the author about. A discriminated union
 * rather than an error-handling library (ADR-0004) -- adding a case here makes
 * every switch over `.kind` fail to compile until it is handled, which is what
 * "matched exhaustively" buys. `unreadable-file` is issue #1's third named error
 * case, "a file that cannot be read as a book" -- it belongs in this union, not a
 * separate type, so loading a file is reported through the same closed surface as
 * every other thing that can go wrong on the way to a repaint. `engine-timeout` is
 * its own case rather than another `pagination-failure` because the two are
 * different events to the author: an engine that refuses a book is answering about
 * the markup they just wrote, and an engine that does not answer at all says
 * nothing about the markup -- the first is resolved by editing, the second by
 * reloading.

 * split (core's two thrown errors, a failed file load, or "something else")
 * applies to printing's own failure just as much as a repaint's. A
 * `pagination-failure` case here did not actually come from the pagination
 * engine, though -- printing.ts's own rejection message already names printing,
 * not pagination, so it is used as-is rather than wrapped in
 * `describePreviewError`'s pagination-specific text. `unreadable-file` can never
 * actually reach this function -- printing has no file to load -- but the
 * branch is required for the same reason the others are: the union is closed,
 * and every switch over it is checked exhaustively. `engine-timeout` is worded
 * here too rather than shared: a print that goes unanswered is not the preview
 * going stale, and the author gave up a minute of standing by for it, so it says
 * so in printing's own terms.
